# Gimbal_Controls
This project gives the user the ability to edit an object spawned

THIS PROJECT IS NOT BUILD SAFE!

|-----------------------------|

This is a project for gimbal controls. There is no click to drag feature for spawning, however, you are able to use it witin a unity editor. 

|-----------------------------|

INSTRUCTIONS:

First open the project within the unity editor and click the button to spawn the cube. This will spawn a prefab. This cube can be edited using scripts based off quaternian angles.

You may rotate on all axis, as well as scale and move.

In addition to this, there is a small orb to the left of the cube that you may move the whole gimbal with as well as the cube itself.

There is no "despawn" feature.
There is also no feature to despawn the spawn button, however, this could easily be implimented.

The coding for the gimbal was not created by me, only implimented. There are other scripts that I did create that can do this within the project, however, I did not have time to complete them and can understand if this is unacceptable. 

The gimbal controls used are on a free lisence.
